## Description

Bob owns a refurbished battery bank composed of second-life lithium-ion batteries, which are available for energy producers and the grid to store surplus energy and withdraw during high demand periods. While Bob provides a valuable service by offering energy storage, he faces difficulties in managing payments from users who store and withdraw energy from his battery bank, as well as the payments he owes to the grid and other stakeholders.

This solution leverages the energy movement records stored on the Unified Energy Interface (UEI) ledger to determine reconciled payments that Bob should receive for storing energy and the total amount he needs to pay for energy withdrawals. By using smart meter data that accurately tracks energy movement, the system calculates precise settlements between Bob, the energy users, and the grid.
## Features

- **Battery Bank Initialisation**: Anyone with extra battery banks initialse themselves.
- **Energy Producers Storing Energy**: Energy Producers can store their energy in these battery banks by paying a charge.
- **Battery Bank Consuming Energy**: Battery Bank can consume energy by paying the producers the cost of energy
- **Detailed Transaction History:**:  Provides a transparent and auditable record of energy transactions, detailing storage and withdrawals for both Bob and the users.
- ** Automated Reconciliation::**:  Automatically reconciles all payments and calculates the exact amounts Bob should receive from users for storing energy, as well as what he owes the grid and other stakeholders..
