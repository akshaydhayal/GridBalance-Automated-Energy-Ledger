# GridBalance: Automated Ledger for Energy Storage Transactions

Live Project Link: [https://gridbalance.vercel.app/](https://gridbalance.vercel.app/)

## Description

GridBalance Ledger is a decentralized platform that leverages smart meter data to automate settlements for energy storage operations. Designed for battery bank owners like Bob, the system tracks energy deposits and withdrawals in real time, calculating precise payments owed by and to all stakeholdersâ€”energy producers, consumers, and the grid. By ensuring transparent, tamper-proof transactions on the Solana blockchain, the platform eliminates manual reconciliation and payment errors, streamlining energy storage economics and incentivizing grid support.
## Features

- **Battery Bank Initialisation**: Anyone with extra battery banks initialse themselves.
- **Energy Producers Storing Energy**: Energy Producers can store their energy in these battery banks by paying a charge.
- **Battery Bank Consuming Energy**: Battery Bank can consume energy by paying the producers the cost of energy
- **Detailed Transaction History:**:  Provides a transparent and auditable record of energy transactions, detailing storage and withdrawals for both Bob and the users.
- ** Automated Reconciliation::**:  Automatically reconciles all payments and calculates the exact amounts Bob should receive from users for storing energy, as well as what he owes the grid and other stakeholders..
